# Store App With Node JS + Express as a backend
- I am thinking to do the frontend with Angular or ReactJS actually i only knows angular.

## Steps to run this application (DEVELOPMENT)
1. clone/download the repository
2. run in cmd ```npm i```
3. create .env file and copy .env.template content and paste in .env, change all of variable that do you want
4. run docker command ```docker compose up -d```
5. If you want seed data in the DB run: ```npm run seed:data:development```
6. finally run app with: ```npm run start:dev```

## If you want to test this app, I am going to write the commands soon
